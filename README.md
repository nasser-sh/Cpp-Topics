# C++ Topics
## About
This repository consists of a set of small projects that are intended to explore the various features, idioms and patterns associated with the C++ programming language. Each subdirectory contains one or more source, as well as a README file with some explanation and references. The source files compile, but the code there is for illustration purposes; there are no build files (yet) and in some cases, no `main()` function.
